# About

Phasmophobia Solver lets your chat help keep track of collected evidence. When evidence is collected and the bot is updated, the
bot will inform chat of the remaining possibilities. Users can also type the !<ghosttype> to get more information about the ghosts.

Textfiles are updated in order to display the contents on stream.

The following commands are available:
- !ghostname - set the name of the ghost
- !ev1 - set evidence #1
