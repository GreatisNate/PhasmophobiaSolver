# About

Phasmophobia Solver lets your chat help keep track of collected evidence. When evidence is collected
and the bot is updated, the bot will inform chat of the remaining possibilities. Users can also type
the !<ghosttype> to get more information about the ghosts.

Textfiles are updated in order to display the contents on stream. HTML files are provided if you'd
like to display the status as images.
